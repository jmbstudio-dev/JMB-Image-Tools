## 🖼️ Image Converter
VIEW LIVE : https://image-converter-canvas.vercel.app/

A fast, private, client-side image converter built with React + Vite. No login, no uploads, no server — everything runs directly in your browser.

> Got tired of looking for a good one on the internet, so I made a simple one. 👍

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Convert images to **WebP, JPEG, PNG, BMP, AVIF**
- 🎚️ **Quality control** slider for lossy formats (WebP, JPEG, AVIF)
- 📦 Batch convert up to **20 files** at once — downloaded as a `.zip`
- 📊 **File size comparison** — see original vs converted size per image
- 🖱️ **Drag & drop** or click to upload
- ⚡ **Parallel conversion** — all files convert simultaneously
- 🔒 **100% private** — your images never leave your device

## 🛡️ Privacy

This tool is entirely client-side. No data is sent to any server. No analytics on your images. No storage. The conversion happens on your own device using the browser's built-in Canvas API.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **AVIF** is supported on Chrome/Edge but may fail on Firefox or Safari — use WebP for broader compatibility
- Very large images (16,000×16,000px+) may fail silently due to browser canvas memory limits
- HEIC/HEIF (iPhone photos) are not currently supported as input

# 🖼️ Image Tools
VIEW LIVE: https://jmb-image-tools.vercel.app/

A fast, private, client-side image toolkit built with React + Vite. No login, no uploads, no server — everything runs directly in your browser.

> Got tired of looking for a good one on the internet, so I made a simple one. 👍

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Converter
- Convert images to **WebP, JPEG, PNG, BMP, AVIF**
- 🖼️ **SVG support** — convert SVG files to any raster format (WebP, JPEG, PNG, BMP, AVIF)
- 📄 **SVG → HTML** — embed an SVG inline in a clean, self-contained HTML file
- 📏 **SVG render size** slider — control output resolution (128px – 4096px, longest side)
- 🎚️ **Quality control** slider for lossy formats (WebP, JPEG, AVIF)
- 📊 **File size comparison** — see original vs converted size per image
- 📦 Batch convert up to **20 files** at once — downloaded as a `.zip`
- ⚡ **Parallel conversion** — all files convert simultaneously

### 🗜️ Compressor
- Compress images while **keeping the original format**
- 🎯 **Target max size** slider (0.1MB – 5MB)
- 📊 **File size comparison** — see how much was saved per image
- 📦 Batch compress up to **20 files** at once — downloaded as a `.zip`
- ⚡ **Parallel compression** — all files compress simultaneously

### 📐 Resizer
- Resize images by **exact pixel dimensions** or **percentage**
- 🔒 **Lock aspect ratio** to avoid distortion
- 📦 Batch resize up to **20 files** at once — downloaded as a `.zip`
- 🎛️ **Same size for all** or **individual settings per image**

### ✂️ Cropper
- Crop images with a **draggable crop box**
- 📐 **Preset ratios** — Free, 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 3:4, 9:16
- 🖼️ **Live preview** of the cropped area
- ⚠️ One image at a time

### General
- 🖱️ **Drag & drop** or click to upload
- 🔒 **100% private** — your images never leave your device
- 🚫 **No login required**

## 🛡️ Privacy

This tool is entirely client-side. No data is sent to any server. No analytics on your images. No storage. All processing happens on your own device using the browser's built-in Canvas API and Web Workers.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **AVIF** is supported on Chrome/Edge but may fail on Firefox or Safari — use WebP for broader compatibility
- Very large images (16,000×16,000px+) may fail silently due to browser canvas memory limits
- Compression target size is a best-effort — exact output size may vary slightly
- HEIC/HEIF (iPhone photos) are not currently supported as input [will work on this]
- Compression time varies by file size and device — large files on mobile may take longer
- Cropper works on one image at a time
- SVG files that use external resources (fonts, images, filters) may not render correctly when converted to raster
- **SVG → HTML** output only supports SVG source files
